Software Defined Network (SDN)
SDN (Software-Defined Networking) is a network architecture approach that allows networks to be  centrally controlled, or 'programmed,' using software applications. Regardless of the underlying network technology, this allows operators to manage the entire network in a consistent and holistic manner.


 The three layers in an SDN architecture are:
Application: the applications and services running on the network.
Control: the SDN controller or brains of the network.
Infrastructure: switches and routers, and the supporting physical hardware.
